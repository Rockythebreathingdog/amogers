      <br />
      Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I feel honored to start this occasion
      by sincerely welcoming everybody, Guests, The Principal, and my dear
      classmates. I would also like to thank those who have helped make this
      event possible.
      <br />
      <br />
      We have gathered here today for our annual Metaday, in where students who
      have worked hard are appointed an award to show that their efforts and
      hard work are valued and noticed by everyone.
      <br />
      <br />
      We wish every one of you a very warm welcome and congratulate those who
      shall be receiving their awards for your great efforts. Once again, thank
      you for having me start this occasion. Relax and have fun. Thank you.

      We're anxious because of homework, because of others, man... we're even
      anxious if the food we're eating is gluten-free. Mark, you're not alone.
      The thing is, anxiety will always stay with us, but it doesn't mean we
      can't control it.
      <br />
      <br />
      I used to feel the same way back then. I remember when I had to give a
      speech for a contest; it was the most nerve-racking experience. The judges
      were not smiling, and my competitors looked like they were about to
      demolish me. While I was sweating like crazy and just wanted to run away.
      But then a voice came and said "you're Martin Luther King." And I kept
      telling myself that I was him. And when it was my time to perform my
      speech, I walked to the stage like I was Martin Luther King and I spoke
      every word like I was Martin Luther King. I faked everything. You are
      probably thinking if I won first place or not. Well, no, I was close to
      last. But I learned one important lesson that day: I could just fake it
      until I make it. Every time I would talk to strangers I would tell myself
      I'm James Bond, every time I wanted to speak to my crush, I told myself
      I'm Tom Cruise. It worked like magic; you should try it.
      <br />
      <br />
      We are anxious beings, but it doesn't mean we can't control how we feel.
      Sometimes you'd just have to say "I'm Tom Cruise" or "I'm Martin Luther
      King." Mark, sometimes you'd have to fake it and once you get used to it,
      you'll forget that you were pretending.
